# 3DImagesOfBrain
Using small 2D images taken from a microscope. Each image is labeled with an x, y, and z value. The x and y value indicate which portion of the bigger image the image is apart of. The z value determines which order the image should be placed at in order for it to make the correct 3D image. The result is two TIFF files.
